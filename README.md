## Day 1
### Work Done: 
 - Explore Unsplash API and Desktop wallpapers alternative

### Problems Faced
 - **Problem**: Anaconda3 package interfered with Gsettings( An API that allows you to access key/value pairs (e.g., persistent application settings) without directly talking to the actual backend that stores that data (config files, gconf, dconf). ).<br/>
 **Solution**: Need to change PATH in .profile file.
 - **Problem**: Unsplash API requires fetch which is a browser API.<br/>
 **Solution**: Used 'node-fetch' and required it in lib file of unsplash.
